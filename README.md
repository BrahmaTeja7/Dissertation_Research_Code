# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms in detection of Fake News

# Introduction
#### This readme file serves a guide in running the python in google collab to view the outcomes of the machine learning models in detection of fake news.

# Libraries required
#### Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, String, Time, matplotlib, seaborn

# Models selected for the research
#### Multinomial Naive Bayes
#### XGboost
#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Cross validation
#### Stratified K Fold cross validation is used to avoid the class imbalance.

# Hyperparameter tuning

#### For Hyperparameter tuning of the selected models, RandomizedSearchCV has been implemented to get the optimal hyperparameter tuning values for the selected machine leanring models.

# Steps involved in running the code in google collab.
#### 1. Select and open the file named "Exploratory_Data_Analysis_for_Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb" and click on the link redirecting to launch the code in google collab.
#### 2. Repeat the step 1 for the files "Fake_News_Prediction_using_Count_Vectorizer_5fold.ipynb" and "Fake_News_Prediction_using_tfidf_Vectorizer_5fold.ipynb".
#### 3. In google collab, there are options to select the CPU and GPU runtime on the right top corner of google collab.
#### 4. Once the runtime is selected of your choice, Load the dataset named "Fake&True_News.csv" in to google collab from the zipped folder of artefacts uploaded as a part of dissertation or extract the dataset from the google drive link mentioned below and upload it to google collab.
#### 5. Wait for the dataset to be uploaded in google collab and once it is uploaded, check for the option named "Runtime" and select the option "Run All" or enter the keyboard command "ctrl" + "f9" to run all the code at a time.
#### 6. Mostly all code will provide immediate results and for some code, it takes time to view the output.
